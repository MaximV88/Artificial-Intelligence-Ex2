This repository contains my solution for implementing value iterator (and resulting policy display) in a way that allows for easy customization. There is a reward and score calculation models which can be extended for further functionality.

###Example

For an input that is formatted as:

4
SHWW
RRWD
RRWD
WRRG

in a .txt file named "input.txt", the resulting output will be:

0,0,D
0,1,D
1,0,RD
1,1,D
1,3,D
2,0,R
2,1,D
2,3,D
3,1,R
3,2,R
